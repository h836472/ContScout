This folder contains a collection of demo data to test ContScout. *Database.tar.gz* holds a small-scale pre-formatted reference database set while *query.tar.gz* contains a test query data.  
  
Please note that both the query and the reference databases have been extensively trimmed to save storage space and runtime.  
They are only meant for demonstration/testing. For a real-life analysis, please download a complete ncbi taxnomy database as well as a reference data set of your choice (nr, refseq, uniprot)

For an automated referebce database download and pre-formatting, you can use the *updateDB* tool within the ContScout docker image.
