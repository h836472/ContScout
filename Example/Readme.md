This folder contains a collection of demo data to test ContScout. File database.tar.gz holds a pre-formatted reference database set while query query.tar.gz contains a demo query data.
Please note that both the query and the reference databases have been trimmed to save storage space and runtime. They can only be used for demonstration. For real-life analysis, please download a complete ncbi taxnomy database as well as a reference data set of your choice (nr, refseq, uniprot)
