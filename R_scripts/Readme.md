For convenient tool deployment, we recommend to use the pre-compiled Docker image, that can be downloaded with the following command: 
docker pull h836472/contscout:develop

If you want to build ContScout on your own, please download the Docker source file from https://github.com/h836472/ContScout/tree/main/DockerScript to build the image. As part of the build process, both the downloader script and the main ContScout script will be automatically imported.
