Please download the Docker source file from https://github.com/h836472/ContScout/tree/main/DockerScript and build the image. As part of the build process, both the downloader script and the main ContScout script will be automatically imported.

Alternatively, you can pull the binary image (including these scripts) directly by docker pull h836472/contscout:latest.
